# How to use the C/C++ version of the DPGNIO



(1) store data and parameters in 'data_all.txt' <br>
(2) set M to be the length of the data ( in '\# define M' ) <br>
(3) run the software and the solution is stored in the variable 'solution'



Notice: the 'data_all.txt' should be of 4M-2 rows, with first M rows to be data, the second M rows to be weights and the last 2M-2 rows to be lambda and mu.
