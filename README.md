# Dynamic Programming algorithm -for-Generalized Nearly Isotonic Optimization (DP-GNIO)
Authors: Xuyu Chen, Xudong Li, and Zhensheng Yu

The DP-GNIO is a package of C/C++ & Python softwares for solving l1 and l2 Generalized Nearly Isotonic Optimization problems
based on the fast and robust dynamic programming algorithm. 

How to use: <br>
(1) unpack DP-GNIO-C for C/C++ version and unpack DP-GNIO-P for Python version. <br>
(2) readin the data and set parameters. <br>
(3) Run! <br>

======================================================================================<br>

A large scale example of the DP-GNIO package is provided, which is taken from our paper( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03305.pdf ). In the example, we apply the DP-GNIO algorithm
to perform isotonic regression on gold price.
