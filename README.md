# Dynamic Programming algorithm -for-Generalized Nearly Isotonic Optimization (DP-GNIO)
# Authors: Xuyu Chen, Xudong Li, and Zhensheng Yu

# The DP-GNIO is a package of C/C++ & Python softwares for solving $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ Generalized Nearly Isotonic Optimization problems
# based on the fast and robust dynamic programming algorithm. 

How to use:
(1) unpack DP-GNIO-C for C/C++ version and unpack DP-GNIO-P for Python version
(2) choose subroutines to solve
