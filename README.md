# Dynamic Programming algorithm -for-Generalized Nearly Isotonic Optimization (DP-GNIO)
Authors: Xuyu Chen, Xudong Li, and Zhensheng Yu


The DP-GNIO is a package of C/C++ & Python softwares for solving l1 and l2 Generalized Nearly Isotonic Optimization problems
based on the fast and robust dynamic programming algorithm. 


How to use: <br>
(1) choose the version (C or Pyhon) you want to use <br>
(2) read corresponding readme files.<br>
(2) readin the data and set parameters. <br>
(3) Run! <br>

===================================================================<br>


A detaild introduction of the GNIO model is seen in our paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03305.pdf ).
